# Form-Submitter
 A simple form that takes clients details and feedback then POSTs the information to an API

I have not included the node_modules folder so in order to do so you must:
1. Open your command console.
2. Run command "yarn install".
3. Wait for the dependencies to upload.
4. Run command "yarn run build:prod". This will run production mode and keep files light.
5. Run command "npm start".
6. Open local server 3000 in a web browser.


Tools I used
1. Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)
2. HTML5
3. CSS (SCSS)
4. JavaScript
5. React
6. Webpack
7. Yarn
8. Babel
9. Live-server
10. Normalize
11. NodeJS
12. ExpressJS
13. Request
14. Google Chrome (emulator, Apple Iphone)
15. Whiteboard (pseudo code and plan of action)
16. Github (version control and delivery system)

Future changes to come
1. Replace date input with b&b date picker
